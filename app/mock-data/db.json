Three years and thousands of bugs later, it is safe to say that Frosty's respect for Angular has never been higher. \n\nHe is an accomplished speaker, having spoken at dozens of mainstream events in five different countries and in two different languages. He is also an accomplished community organizer. His first start in community organizing was helping out with the GDG Utah, helping out as both a presenter and a co-organizer. He is most know for his help in co-organizing ng-conf, the world's favorite Angular conference.\n\nHaving worked with many technologies in his career, Frosty has chosen to focus on the web. His opinions are many, and if you want to know what they are, just ask. ",
